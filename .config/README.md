# Mac dotfiles

These are my configuration files for Mac OS. Stole/borrowed most of the ideas from [mehd-io](https://github.com/mehd-io/dotfiles/tree/aerospace-sketchybar). I'd recommend starting with [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjR2eiomRwo&t=1s) to see what you're getting into with a TWM like Aerospace.

## Apps to make TWM work

* [Aerospace - a TWM like i3](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace)
* [JankyBorders - highlights focused window](https://github.com/FelixKratz/JankyBorders)
* [Kitty - not necessary but themeable](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)
